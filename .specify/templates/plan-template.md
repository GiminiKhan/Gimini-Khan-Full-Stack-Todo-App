# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
- [ ] All features and changes must be specified before implementation begins
- [ ] Clear requirements and acceptance criteria must be documented in spec.md

### No Manual Code
- [ ] All code must be generated through Claude Code or integrated agents
- [ ] No manual code writing is permitted
- [ ] Implementation must follow automated generation processes

### Agentic Stack
- [ ] Technology stack utilizes UV, Python 3.13+, and Claude Code as required components
- [ ] Agentic approach ensures automation and consistency across development lifecycle

### Clean Architecture
- [ ] Codebase maintains modular and clean architecture principles using Cloud-Native Architecture (FastAPI + Neon PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Architecture ensures maintainability, testability, scalability, and robust data persistence

### Process Integrity
- [ ] Every code change references a Task ID before implementation
- [ ] Traceability and accountability maintained throughout development process

### Security Protocol
- [ ] Better Auth with JWT implemented as mandatory security protocol for all authentication and authorization flows
- [ ] Secure user access, token management, and protection of sensitive data across all application layers

### Frontend Standard
- [ ] Next.js 15+ App Router used as the standard for all frontend development
- [ ] Modern React development practices, server-side rendering capabilities, and optimized performance ensured

### UI/UX Standards
- [ ] Modern & Attractive UI implemented using Tailwind CSS with Indigo/Slate theme
- [ ] Consistent visual identity, responsive design, accessibility compliance, and enhanced user experience maintained

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
